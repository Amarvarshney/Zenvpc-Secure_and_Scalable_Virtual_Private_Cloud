# zenvpc
Description:
Zenvpc is a cloud networking project that focuses on designing and deploying a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to provide secure, isolated, and scalable infrastructure for hosting applications and services. The project involves creating a customized network architecture with public and private subnets, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, route tables, and security groups to ensure both accessibility and data protection.

How it Solves Real-World Problems:

🌍 Secure Application Hosting: In real-world businesses, sensitive applications (like databases) must not be directly exposed to the internet. Zenvpc places them in private subnets, shielding them from external threats.

🚀 Scalability for Modern Apps: By separating public-facing services (web servers) from internal services (databases, APIs), Zenvpc supports microservices and scalable architectures that businesses need today.

🔐 Controlled Access: With fine-grained security groups and network ACLs, organizations can strictly control which traffic enters or leaves their environment, reducing cyberattack risks.

💰 Cost-Effective Cloud Operations: Using NAT gateways only for private subnet internet access reduces unnecessary resource exposure and optimizes costs compared to traditional networking setups.

⚡ Real-World Use Case Example:

A retail e-commerce platform could host its website in the public subnet while keeping its payment and customer databases in the private subnet, ensuring customers enjoy smooth access without compromising sensitive data.

Tech Stack & Tools:

AWS VPC, Subnets (Public/Private)

Internet Gateway (IGW), NAT Gateway

Route Tables, Security Groups, NACLs

EC2 instances for compute workloads

👉 This way, Zenvpc isn’t just “a cloud networking project,” but a practical solution to security, scalability, and cost-efficiency — something recruiters or stakeholders can easily connect with.
